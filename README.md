Separable Hamiltonian Neural Networks

Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs) are state-of-the-art models that regress the vector field of a dynamical system under the learning bias of Hamiltonâ€™s equations. 
A recent observation is that embedding a bias regarding the additive separability of the Hamiltonian reduces the regression complexity and improves regression performance.
We propose \textit{separable HNNs} that embed additive separability within HNNs using observational, learning, and inductive biases. We show that the proposed models are more effective than the HNN at regressing the Hamiltonian and the vector field, and have the capability to interpret the kinetic and potential energy of the system.
